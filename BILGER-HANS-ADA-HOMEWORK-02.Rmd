###Challenge #1: Poisson distributions

####1.a. What is the probability that she will hear more than 8 calls during any given session?

```{r}

#We can use the probability mass function for the Poisson Distribution to determine this: 

e <- 2.71828
fish <- function(l, x) {
  ((l^x * e^(-l)) / factorial(x))
} 

fish(15, 8)

```

```{r}

#So, the probability of hearing more than 8 calls in a given session should be:
# P(>8) = 1 - P(<=8) = 1 - (P(0:8)

1 - sum(fish(15, 0:8))               

```

####1.b. What is the probability that she will hear no calls in a session?

```{r}

fish(15, 0)

```

####1.c. What is the probability that she will hear exactly 3 calls in a session?

```{r}

fish(15, 3)

```

####1.d. Plot the relevant Poisson mass function over the values in range 0 ≤ x ≤ 30

```{r}

x <- 0:30
l = 15
monkeycalls <- dpois(x = x, lambda = l)
barplot(monkeycalls, names.arg = x, space = 0, xlab = "x", ylab = "Pr(X = x)", main = paste0("Probability Mass Function\nlambda = ", 
    l))

```

####1.e. Simulate 104 results from this distribution (i.e., 2 years of Saturday monitoring sessions).

```{r}

x <- 0:30
l = 15
monkeycalls <- dpois(x = x, lambda = l)

n <- 104
sim <- function(n) {
  sample(monkeycalls, n, replace = TRUE)
}

sim(n)

```

####1.f. Plot the simulated results using hist() and use xlim() to set the horizontal limits to be from 0 to 30. How does your histogram compare to the shape of the probability mass function you plotted above?

```{r}

hist(sim(n))

sim(n)
nrolls <- 1000
roll <- function(x) {
    sample(1:6, x, replace = TRUE)
}


```
