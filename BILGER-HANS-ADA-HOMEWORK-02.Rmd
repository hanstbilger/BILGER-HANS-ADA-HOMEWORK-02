###Challenge #1: Poisson distributions

####1.a. What is the probability that she will hear more than 8 calls during any given session?
```{r}

#We can use the probability mass function for the Poisson distribution to determine this: 

e <- 2.71828
fish <- function(l, x) {
  ((l^x * e^(-l)) / factorial(x))
} 

fish(15, 8)

#or we can also use the functionality built into base R:

dpois(x = 8, lambda = 15)

```

```{r}

# So, the probability of hearing more than 8 calls in a given session should be:
# P(>8) = 1 - P(<=8) = 1 - (P(0:8))

1 - sum(fish(15, 0:8))          

# or

1 - sum(dpois(x = 0:8, lambda = 15))

# or, using cumulative distribution functions

1- ppois(q = 8, lambda = 15)


```

####1.b. What is the probability that she will hear no calls in a session?

```{r}

fish(15, 0)

#or

dpois(x = 0, lambda = 15)

```

####1.c. What is the probability that she will hear exactly 3 calls in a session?

```{r}

fish(15, 3)

# or

dpois(x = 3, lambda = 15)

```

####1.d. Plot the relevant Poisson mass function over the values in range 0 ≤ x ≤ 30

```{r}

x <- 0:30
l = 15
monkeycalls <- dpois(x = x, lambda = l)
barplot(monkeycalls, names.arg = x, space = 0, xlab = "x", ylab = "Pr(X = x)", main = paste0("Probability Mass Function\nlambda = ", 
    l))

```

####1.e. Simulate 104 results from this distribution (i.e., 2 years of Saturday monitoring sessions).

```{r}

TwoYears <- rpois(104, 15)
TwoYears

```

####1.f. Plot the simulated results using hist() and use xlim() to set the horizontal limits to be from 0 to 30. How does your histogram compare to the shape of the probability mass function you plotted above?

```{r}

hist(TwoYears, xlim = c(0,30), xlab = "# of calls", ylab = "Frequency", prob = TRUE)

# My histogram looks similar to the shape of the probability mass function plotted above, but the shape of the curve is not quite as smooth. I assume this is because the histogram is constructed from fewer observations.
```

#Challenge 2: Zombies

```{r}
library(curl)
f <- f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ADA-2019/master/zombies.csv")
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(d)
d
```

####2.a. Calculate the population mean and standard deviation for each quantitative random variable (height, weight, age, number of zombies killed, and years of education).

```{r}
library(dplyr)
meanHeight <- mean(d$height)
meanHeight
meanWeight <- mean(d$weight)
meanWeight
meanAge <- mean(d$age)
meanAge
meanKilled <- mean(d$zombies_killed)
meanKilled
meanEd <- mean(d$years_of_education)
meanEd

sdHeight <- sqrt(sum((d$height - mean(d$height))^2)/(1000))
sdHeight
sdWeight <- sqrt(sum((d$weight - mean(d$weight))^2)/(1000))
sdWeight
sdAge <- sqrt(sum((d$age - mean(d$age))^2)/(1000))
sdAge
sdKilled <- sqrt(sum((d$zombies_killed - mean(d$zombies_killed))^2)/(1000))
sdKilled
sdEd <- sqrt(sum((d$years_of_education - mean(d$years_of_education))^2)/(1000))
sdEd

```

####2.b. Use {ggplot} and make boxplots of each of these variable by gender.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(cowplot)

# mean boxplots
HeightBP <- ggplot(d, aes(x=gender, y=height)) + 
  geom_boxplot()

WeightBP <- ggplot(d, aes(x=gender, y=weight)) + 
  geom_boxplot()

AgeBP <- ggplot(d, aes(x=gender, y=age)) + 
  geom_boxplot()

KilledBP <- ggplot(d, aes(x=gender, y=zombies_killed)) + 
  geom_boxplot()

EdBP <- ggplot(d, aes(x=gender, y=years_of_education)) + 
  geom_boxplot()

plot_grid(HeightBP, WeightBP, AgeBP, KilledBP, EdBP)
```

####2.c. Use {ggplot} and make scatterplots of height and weight in relation to age. Do these variables seem to be related? In what way?

```{r}
HeightVsAge <- ggplot(d, aes(x=age, y=height)) +
                        geom_point()

WeightVsAge <- ggplot(d, aes(x=age, y=weight)) +
                  geom_point()

plot_grid(HeightVsAge, WeightVsAge)
# Both of these variables seem to have a positive correlation with age.
```

####2.d. Using histograms and Q-Q plots, check whether the quantitative variables seem to be drawn from a normal distribution. Which seem to be and which do not?

```{r}
library(cowplot)

hist.height <- ggplot(d, aes(x=height)) +
  geom_histogram()

hist.weight <- ggplot(d, aes(x=weight)) +
  geom_histogram()

hist.age <- ggplot(d, aes(x=age)) +
  geom_histogram()

hist.killed <- ggplot(d, aes(x=zombies_killed)) +
  geom_histogram()

hist.ed <- ggplot(d, aes(x=years_of_education)) +
  geom_histogram()

qq.height <- ggplot(d, aes(sample=height)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line() +
  ggtitle("Height")

qq.weight <- ggplot(d, aes(sample=weight)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line() +
  ggtitle("Weight")

qq.age <- ggplot(d, aes(sample=age)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line() +
  ggtitle("Age")

qq.killed <- ggplot(d, aes(sample=zombies_killed)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line() +
  ggtitle("Killed")

qq.ed <- ggplot(d, aes(sample=years_of_education)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line() +
  ggtitle("Years of Education")


plot_grid(hist.height, qq.height, hist.weight, qq.weight, hist.age, qq.age, hist.killed, qq.killed, hist.ed, qq.ed)

# Height, weight, and age appear to be normally distributed. zombies_killed, and years_of_education appear not to be normally distributed.

```

####2.e. Now use the sample() function to sample ONE subset of 30 zombies (without replacement) from this population and calculate the mean and sample standard deviation for each variable. Also estimate the standard error for each variable and construct the 95% confidence interval for each mean. Note that for the variables that are not drawn from the normal distribution, you will need to base your estimate of the CIs on some different distribution!
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
Zsample <- sample_n(d, 30)

mZsample_height <- mean(Zsample$height)
mZsample_height
sdZsample_height <- sd(Zsample$height)
sdZsample_height
seZsample_height <- sdZsample_height/sqrt(length(Zsample$height))

CI_height <- c(mZsample_height-critvalZsample_height*seZsample_height, mZsample_height+critval*seZsample_height)
CI_height

mZsample_weight <- mean(Zsample$weight)
mZsample_weight
sdZsample_weight <- sd(Zsample$weight)

CI_age

mZsample_killed <- mean(Zsample$zombies_killed)
mZsample_killed
sdZsample_killed <- sd(Zsample$zombies_killed)
sdZsample_killed
seZsample_killed <- sdZsample_killed/sqrt(length(Zsample$zombies_killed))
seZsample_killed

var(Zsample$zombies_killed)
#[1] 2.822989
mean(Zsample$zombies_killed)
#[1] 2.933333

#The data are right skewed, and the population mean and variance are close to equal. Also, number of zombies killed seems potentially reasonable to model as an open ended count of independently occurring events. For these reasons, I will use a Poisson distribution to construct my confidence interval.

critvalZsample_killed <- qpois(0.975, lambda = mZsample_killed)
